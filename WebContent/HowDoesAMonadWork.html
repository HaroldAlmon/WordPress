<p>Once you understand how a monad works, you lose the ability to explain it to anyone else. That might be true but I am going to try to explain what a monad is without referring to abstract category theory concepts.</p>
<p>When I was in university, the professor when through the formal definition of a mathematical limit. The definition was abstract and solving problems with limits did not require understanding the definition of a limit so I made it through the class without really grasping the definition.</p>
<p>After I graduated, I spent hours going over the definition and finally understood the definition by showing that if:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">$latex f(x)=x &s=4$</p>

<p>then</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">$latex lim_{x\to 5}\ f(x) <> 6 &s=4$</p>

<p>Obviously the correct solution is 5 but proving the result was not 6 forced me to understand the definition of a limit. I am using a similar strategy here except that I want you to understand that <strong>a monad with just <em>map</em> will not work and that a monad with just <em>flatMap</em> will not work. Understand that and you understand the monad.</strong></p>

<p>A monad provides the capability of executing a lambda expression and then capturing the result of the computation in a monad.  The capture of the result allows the chaining of lambda expressions that are applied to the data contained in the monad. <strong></p>

<p></>A monad works by offering two very important functions that are common to all monads, <em>map</em> and <em>flatMap</em>.</strong> The purpose of <em>map</em> is to apply a lambda expression and then place the result of the evaluation in the monad. The purpose of <em>flatMap</em> is to apply a lambda expression and return the evaluation. <strong><em>flatMap</em> DOES NOT place the evaluation result in a monad because the lambda expression returns a value that is already in a monad.</strong></p>
<p>Keeping the result in a monad is the key to how a monad can be chained with other lambda expressions. The <em>flatMap</em> allows function composition. This is useful for languages like Haskell and Scala that have for-comprehensions. A for-comprehension is mapped by the compiler to composite lambda expressions. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mw_Jnn_Y5iA" target="_blank">Declutter Your Code With Monadic Design</a> for a demonstration of how this works. Let's have a look at a simple monad class written in Scala and see how it works.</p>

<p>The following Scala code demonstrates how a monad works but also shows why two functions, <em>map</em> and <em>flatMap</em> are necessary to implement a monad. You could just have <em>flatMap</em>em> but then the Monad could not support a for-comprehension. for-comprehensions look somewhat like a traditional for-loops but the construct is logically equivalent to a lambda expression.</p>

<h3>The SingleArgumentMonad Class</h3>

<pre>package com.translationdata.prototypes

// Note that the constructor creates the value-field...
class SingleArgumentMonad[A](val value: A) {
  // This function extracts the value-field from the monad and passes
  // it to f() and wraps the result from f() of type B into a Monad.
  // The value-field is mapped to the input of the lambda expression.
  def map[B](f:A => B) = new SingleArgumentMonad(f(value))

  // This function extracts the value-field from the monad and passes
  // back the result of f() which is a Monad that wraps type B...
  def flatMap[B](f:A => SingleArgumentMonad[B]) = f(value)

  // Need this function to get the string value of the value-field...
  override def toString = value.toString
}
</pre>

<h3>The Monad Companion Object</h3>

<p>This object is only here to test the monad.</p>

<pre>object SingleArgumentMonad {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val monadWith4 = new SingleArgumentMonad(4)
    val monadWith5 = new SingleArgumentMonad(5)

    val forResult = for {
      x <- monadWith4 // The flatMap function reads the value instance variable from the monad
      y <- monadWith5 // The map function reads the value instance variable from the monad
    } yield x + y

    println("Result = " + forResult)
  }
</pre>
<p>The result is:</p>
<pre>
Result = 9
</pre>
<h3>for-comprehensions are Logically Equivalent to Lambda Expressions</h3>
<p>I am now going to convert the for-comprehension above into composite lambda expressions to demonstrate that the for-comprehension is logically equivalent to lambda expressions with <em>map</em> and <em>flatMap</em> calls. <strong>
<br>
<p>Step 1. Convert first part of the <em>for</em> to flatMap</strong></p>

<pre>val flatMapAndForResult =
	monadWith4.flatMap { x =>
		for {
			y <- monadWith5
		} yield x + y
	}
</pre>
<br>
<p><strong>Step 2. Convert second part of the <em>for</em> to map.</strong></p>

<pre>val flatMapAndMapResult = 
	monadWith4.flatMap { x =>
		monadWith5.map { y => x + y }
	}
</pre>
<p><strong>Now run the program. The result is 9.</strong> Based on what I see in the debugger this is how the code works. It is easier to understand the execution by working from right to left but the debugger shows the runtime working from left to right as detailed below.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Execute the monadWith4.flatMap function. This steps takes the 4 in the monad and substitutes the 4 into <em>monadWith5.map { y =&gt; x + y }</em> which yields <em>monadWith5.map { y =&gt; 4 + y }</em>.</li>
	<li>Execute the <em>monadWith5.map</em> function. This step takes the 3 in the monad and substitutes the 5 into<em> y =&gt; 4 + y</em> which yields 5<em> =&gt; 4 + 9</em></li>
	<li>Evaluate 4 + 5 which yields 9. So 9 is the result BUT the monad member function in the class wraps the 9 in a SingleArgumentMonad. So the flatMapAndMapResult variable ends up containing a monad that contains a 9.</li>
</ol>

<p>I could stop here but some additional examples should demonstrate why two functions are necessary for every monad. If you understand why a monad cannot function with just <em>map</em> or just <em>flatMap</em> then you should understand how monads work.</p>
