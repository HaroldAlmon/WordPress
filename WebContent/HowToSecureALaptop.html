<h3>Protect Your Laptop by Locking It Up</h3>
<p>If you you store your laptop in the trunk of your car or hide it under the bed when you go to work, you might want to consider a personal storage that can be used to secure a laptop. A personal storage box might be right for you if you do not want an expensive upright safe.</p>
<p>These personal storage boxes can also be used in your car or truck if you have the storage box attached to your car.  Installation by a body shop is probably the best option for people who do not know much about car mechanics. If you are installing the storage box in your home, consider hiding the box in a closet or cabinet. What cannot be found cannot be stolen. Use an unusual location, put a fake cover on the box, anything to make it's location inconspicuous.</p>
<h3>Honeywell 5105 Low Profile Steel Security Safe</h3>
<p>This imported safe is the least expensive storage box that I could find that just barely holds a 17 inch laptop.  The body and the door are at probably 12 or 14 gauge steel based on the weight although no specifications were available. The safe is extremely affordable, currently retailing at around $125 USD.</p>

<p>I do not know if this electronic lock is vulnerable to <b>electromagnetic pulse</b> (<b>EMP</b>) but that is not something I worry about. I do not know if the safe is vulnerable to rare-earth magnet attacks, but only the professional thieves would have these and need to know the internal construction of this box. The lock locks out the user user for five minutes after three wrong combinations. This is inconvenient if you are rushing to work  and need to fetch your laptop. Also if the batteries are dead, you cannot open the safe.</p>
<p>If you just want to store electronics against smash and grab attacks without spending a lot of money then this might be right for you. This might also be a good option for a car since I assume most car thieves are not prepared to open a personal storage safe. The pre-drilled holes are on the back of the safe and there is a second set of holes on the bottom.</p>
<p>Overall, I think the thickness of the steel is alright for an entry level safe but do not know if the lock or the bolts are good enough to defeat a pry attack. The box, however, is certainly good enough to keep out children, visitors, or unskilled thieves.</p>
<h3><a href="http://cesafes.com/security-boxes-safe-accessories/security-boxes/" target="_blank">Fort Knox Controlled Access Box</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.ftknox.com/" target="_blank">Fort Knox</a> is known for its premium high quality safes that are some of the best in the business. This is the most expensive storage box I found but also offers the heaviest body and has a proven mechanical lock.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
[caption id="attachment_921" align="alignright" width="257"]<img class="wp-image-921 size-full" src="http://www.translationdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Controlled-Access-Box-CAB-e1454008464408.png" alt="Secure a laptop with a Fort Knox Controlled Access Box" width="257" height="166" /> Fort Knox Controlled Access Box[/caption]
<p>This storage box features a 10 gauge body, 3/16 plate steel door, and a Simplex lock. Steel this thick is only available in mid-rage safes that start at four times the price  (currently around $1,500 USD) of this storage box (currently around $400 USD). A high security burglar safe starts around $800 USD but might not be big enough to hold a laptop. The smallest Fort Knox box weighs 43 pounds, more that the Honeywell 5105 that weighs 32 pounds.</p>
<p>The Fort Knox front door is protected by the Simplex lock and welds on the outside and inside of the safe that connect the hinge to the plate steel door. This storage box comes in three sizes and I recommend the small or middle size because the largest size is difficult to place in a closet because it is so wide.  </p>
<p>The small or mid-size box easily holds a 15 inch PC and should fit into a closet without any problems. The mid-size should hold a 17 inch laptop but that laptop might not fit in the small size because it's not as deep as the larger versions. All of them are tall enough to hold several PC's stacked on top of each other. No matter what size you choose make sure to measure your laptop to make sure it will fit in the box and remember the inside dimensions of the box are less than the published outside dimensions. The Fort Know has four pre-drilled mounting holes on the bottom of the unit making installation on a floor relatively easy.</p>
<h3>The Simplex Lock</h3>
<p>The simplex lock is a proven device that has recently been enhanced to protected against attacks by rare earth magnets.  If you forget the combination, the only practical way to get in is to open it with a heavy duty grinder at a later time. That's why you need to bolt down the safe to concrete or a heavy wood floor. If a thief cannot steal the box, it's really tough to break in. The simplex lock is simply the best for quick access in an emergency if you need a firearm. You should be able to open the unit in one to two seconds less if you choose a really simple combination.</p>
<p>There is no lockout period or key to lose like other units. For this reason, Curt Price a former police officer and the owner of <a href="http://cesafes.com/" target="_blank">C.E. Safes</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltK-bDbADa8" target="_blank">only recommends boxes of this type (see @23:00) that have Simplex locks</a>. Curt mainly sells storage boxes to people storing firearms who need quick and reliable access. The Simplex lock is also immune to Electro Magnetic Pulse and required no batteries.  The lock is one hundred percent mechanical. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzMoe3GdJ2k" target="_blank">Simplex Lock Video: How to Change the Combination</a> shows how to reset the combination on a Simplex lock.</p>
<h3>The Best Warranty</h3>
<p>The Fort Knox box has a lifetime warranty that includes the Simplex lock that is not even made by Fort Knox.  This is the best guarantee in the business. The Fort Knox box is the most secure choice for anyone storing several PC's in their home who wants entry level protection to protect a laptop from theft but does want to pay about five times more for a stand-up safe with the same body thickness.</p>
<p>If price is not an issue, then the small Fort Knox box is a great option for storing a laptop in a car or truck. The other choice, the Honeywell, is obviously the best value but I do not know how the actual thickness of the door and body nor if it is strong enough to resist a pry attack.</p>

<h3>Want more security?</h3>
<p>You need an upright safe to get more security and need to avoid the low end models available at the big box stores. Expect to pay at least twice the price of the Fort Knox storage box for a <strong>small</strong> half height safe.  A quality full height safe will cost about four time that amount and a full size heavy safe will cost about ten times that amount. You can add options like thicker steel, stainless steel, and AR500 steel that can double the cost of the safe. An alternative to a an expensive upright safe is a TL-15 or TL-30 (American) rated burglar safe.</p>
<p>Europe has a different rating system but the idea is the same, a high security safe is designed to resists attacks from tools and/or torches for a minimum period of time. Some are big enough to hold laptops and have much thicker steel than a gun safe at the same price. They are typically used by jewelers and stores but there is no reason you cannot use one to store laptops.
