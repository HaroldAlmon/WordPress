<p>May 15, 2016 kicked off the first <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Dallas-Big-Data-Science/events/230727532/" target="_blank">Dallas Big Data Science Vendor Day</a> where big data vendors were able to show their products and people interested in the data science had the opportunity to meet and mingle with the vendors and other individuals in the field. The event was organised by the Dallas Big Data meetup and sponsored by Capitol One at their conference center in Plano, Texas.</p>
<p>I arrived fifteen minutes early and was surprised to be the first one there but a crowd soon started forming.  Sixty six people were registered for the event but I estimate that more like one hundred and fifty actually attended. I think a lot of Capitol one employees attended without registering.</p>

<p>With so many vendors each attendee could only attend four presentations. Here is a rundown of the vendor presentations that I attended. </p>
<h3>H2O</h3>
<p>The room was packed for this presentation. H2O has 25,000 users worldwide of it's machine learning software. H2O is open source but has some big players like Capitol One, Cisco, and Paypal that use its software. H2O interfaces with popular tools like R, Python, and Spark. Hadoop users can still get data into the system because H2O reads HDFS and SQL database data. H2O runs in memory and provides access to a wide range of machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p>I like this product because it's open source and anyone can download it and start using it with a fee. H2O makes money by selling the product to corporate that need enterprise support. That's a sweet deal, corporations get the support and consulting services they need and everyone else gets the product at no charge.</p>

<h3>Domino</h3>
<p>Domino offers a product that helps centralize, version, and test software development. This product is designed to improve control and management of projects. As developers change their code, the system automatically creates new versions and saves them in Git.</p>
<p>One of the big problems faced by development organizations is the control and organization of artifacts such as code, data, and tools. Domino looks like it might be worth acquiring just for its ability to tract the results of analytical experiments. For me, it takes a lot of time to track experiments and the results can contain keying errors since I'm the one entering the data.</p>
<p>If you are looking for system that is designed to manage these artifacts, Domino is worth some investigation.</p>
<h3>Fuzzy Logix</h3>
<p>This company offers a suite of functions that support statistical and analytical functions.  Their software runs on Hadoop and some relational database systems plus it also has interfaces for Python, R, and other languages. While a lot of the big data world runs on HDFS and document databases, companies still have a significant amount of data stored in relational databases. Fuzzy Logix software installs into these database systems in about ten minutes and run natively in the database server resulting in exceptional performance.</p>
<h3>AT&amp;T Big Data Science Presentation</h3>
<p>Marty McEnroe gave an overview of how AT&amp;T is using big data to analyse and reduce costs. For instance, AT&amp;T has can monitor television usage and determine if the advertising dollars they spend are actually producing content that reaches the intended market.</p>
<p>Marty McEnroe gave an interesting use case for predictive modelling. AT&amp;T has crews that install internet and video services. These trucks have batteries that wear out and can leave a driver stranded if the battery fails.  This results in several losses for the company.</p>
<p>First, ATT has to pay for a tow truck to tow the disable vehicle to a garage for a battery replacement. Second, the AT&amp;T driver is being paid but cannot perform the installation. Third, the customer is upset because the AT&amp;T truck did not arrive and the customer will not be paying for the service that was not installed. So this is more lost revenue for AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>By using predictive analytics, AT&amp;T can predict when the batteries will fail and proactively warn the maintenance staff to replace the batteries. Since not everyone followed the advice, AT&amp;T had a control group of people that showed that the predictive analytics were indeed generating a significant cost savings.</p>
<h3>Other Vendors</h3>
<p>I did not get to attend the presentations by these vendors but I did chat with them at the beginning of the day.</p>
<h3>Ryft</h3>
<p>Ryft was the only vendor with a hardware based solution. There solution, with massive amounts of processing power and memory, offered the ability to load files into memory and could make the data appear to be part of a database without actually loading the data into a database.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to donate a used Ryft system, please let me know. I have a nice spot for it on my desk ;-)</p>
